## Classes

> **Classes** are software programming models - abstractions of the real world or system entities. 

- Classes have *state* and *behaviour*

- *Variables* are used to describe the state of the class and methods are used to describe behaviour

- Classes are collections of objects with common structure, common behaviour, common relationships and common semantics

- Objects belong to a particular class, objects are instances of a particular class 

---

## Classes & Objects (2)

- **Class**
  - a template that describes the data and behaviour associated with instances of that class
  - the basic building block of an object-oriented language such as C++, C#, Java, Kotlin etc.
  - classes are data types and can be used to create multiple objects

- **Object**
  - represents something with which we can interact with in a program
  - an objectâ€™s behaviour defines a collection of services that we can tell it to perform for us
  - a class is abstract and represents a concept, and an object represents an instance (realisation) of a class 

---

## Class - an Example

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

![h:500](../../figures/class_diagram.svg)

</div>

<div style="font-size:26px; margin-top:1px ">

```c#
class Module {
 string name;
 string code;
 int year;

 register(){

 }

 unregister(){

 }

}

```

</div>
<div>

---

## Objects


- An Object is an instance of a class and a group of objects for the same class have sepatate memory addresses. 
  
<div align=center>

![h:500](../../figures/class_diagram_2.svg)

</div>


---


## Abstraction

- Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
Abstraction can be achieved with either `abstract` classes or `interfaces` 

- The `abstract` keyword is used for classes and methods:
  - Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).

  - Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the derived class (inherited from).

---


## Inheritance

- Another class can inherit another classes functionality
- All methods, fields, variables, functions etc must be implemented and cannot be modified.
- Class can inherit only one abstract class.
- Optional implementation of abstract class internals.

## Inheritance and abstraction 

```c#
abstract class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }

    public abstract void DisplayDetails();
}

class Student : Person
{
    public int StudentId { get; set; }

    public override void DisplayDetails()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Student: {Name}, Age: {Age}, Student ID: {StudentId}");
    }
}

```

---

## Interface

- Interface Class is like a header file in C
- It includes fields (setters,getters) and prototypes
- There is no body to any prototype, this is handled by the implementing class. 
- You still have to include all the "code" in the implementing function, but it does not have to action it.
