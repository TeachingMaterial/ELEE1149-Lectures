## Classes

> **Classes** are software programming models - abstractions of the real world or system entities. 

- Classes have *state* and *behaviour*

- *Variables* are used to describe the state of the class and methods are used to describe behaviour

- Classes are collections of objects with common structure, common behaviour, common relationships and common semantics

- Objects belong to a particular class, objects are instances of a particular class 

---

---

## Classes & Objects (2)

- **Class**
  - a template that describes the data and behaviour associated with instances of that class
  - the basic building block of an object-oriented language such as C++, C#, Java, Kotlin etc.
  - classes are data types and can be used to create multiple objects

- **Object**
  - represents something with which we can interact with in a program
  - an object’s behaviour defines a collection of services that we can tell it to perform for us
  - a class is abstract and represents a concept, and an object represents an instance (realisation) of a class

## Class - an Example

<div align=center>

![h:500](../../figures/class_diagram.svg)

</div>

---

## Class – an Example 2

<div align=center>

![h:500](../../figures/class_diagram_2.svg)

</div>


---

## Objects

- An Object is an instance of a class and a group of objects for the same class have sepatate memory addresses.

## Abstraction

---

## Inheritance

- Another class can inherit another classes functionality
- All methods, fields, variables, functions etc must be implemented and cannot be modified.

---


## Interface

- Interface Class is like a header file in C
- It includes fields (setters,getters) and prototypes
- There is no body to any prototype, this is handled by the implementing class. 
- You still have to include all the "code" in the implementing function, but it does not have to action it.
